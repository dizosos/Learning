### What I learned

I learned how to center things vertically

''body{
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    font-size: 15px;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    min-height: 100vh; **This line especially**
    display: flex;
    align-items: center ;
}''

also i learned how @import works by this:

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');


### Continued development

I need to practice more with CSS and HTML to better understand how things can be moved
